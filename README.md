# AI_Projects
As a beginner in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, I have embarked on several projects to gain hands-on experience and showcase my skills in these domains. My portfolio includes a decision tree, a genetic algorithm program, a neural network, and an SVM.

- DT:
My decision tree project was focused on building a data structure for decision trees from scratch, without using any pre-existing libraries. Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of the decision tree structure in artificial intelligence and utilized several techniques to improve its speed and efficiency.

- Neural networks:
My neural network project consists of several parts, each of which is explained in Persian in the project description. In general, I became familiar with practical aspects of training and learning in multi-layer perceptron networks. I worked with various parameters of neural networks and ultimately used a multi-layer perceptron network for data classification, particularly the MNIST dataset.

- SVM:
In my support vector machine project, various parts investigate the use of different kernels for the machine and determine which is more suitable for different types of data. I also utilized 3D data in my project, and all details are explained in the documentation.
