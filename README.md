# AI_Projects
As a beginner in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, I have embarked on several projects to gain hands-on experience and showcase my skills in these domains. My portfolio includes a decision tree, a genetic algorithm program, a neural network, and an SVM.

My decision tree project was focused on building a data structure for decision trees from scratch, without using any pre-existing libraries. Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of the decision tree structure in artificial intelligence and utilized several techniques to improve its speed and efficiency.
